	<h2>jstyle - Programming with styles</h2>
	<p>We wanted to have some dynamic parts in our CSS, but since we are client side for these things, we needed something on the browser<br/>
		jstyle is that. A tiny library that build a stylesheet from a JSON definition.<br />The advantages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Very small foot print added to a current css (~1.2 Kb)
		<li>Use variables
		<li>Use functions
		<li>Similar syntax as the usual css
		<li>Add browser specific logic
		<li>Use iterations
	</ul>
