<h1>jstyle - Programmed styles</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We wanted to have some dynamic parts in our CSS, but since we are client side for these things, we needed something on the browser<br/>
	jstyle is that. A tiny library that build a stylesheet from a JSON definition.<br />The advantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Very small foot print added to a current css (~1.2 Kb)
	<li>Use variables
	<li>Use functions
	<li>Similar syntax as the usual css
	<li>Add browser specific logic
	<li>Use iterations
</ul>
